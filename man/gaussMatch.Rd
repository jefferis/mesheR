\arguments{
\item{x}{reference mesh: triangular mesh of class "mesh3d"or of class BayesDeform created by createBayes to restrict based on a known distribution. To use this option the package RvtkStatismo \url{https://github.com/zarquon42b/RvtkStatismo} has to be installed. If x is a model, it works best if mesh2 is already aligned to the model's mean.}

\item{mesh2}{An object of class mesh3d used as target mesh. Mesh resolution
should be ~1.5.}

\item{iterations}{Iterations of displacement. Default is 10.}

\item{smooth}{Integer: smoothing factor. Default is NULL, no smoothing.}

\item{smoothit}{integer: smoothing steps.}

\item{smoothtype}{Type of smoothing: Taubin, Laplacian, or HClaplacian. For
details see \code{\link{vcgSmooth}}}

\item{sigma}{starting parameter for smoothed displacement (see Moshfeghi
1994). Sigma controls the importance of the neighbourhood by defining the standard-deviation for the gaussian smoothing}

\item{gamma}{stiffness factor controlling displacement strength. The smoothed displacement vector for each vertex is divided by \code{gamma}. The larger \code{gamma}, the slower the approximation.}

\item{f}{parameter controlling iterative decrease of \code{sigma} making the displacement locally more elastic with each iteration.
(Moshfeghi 1994). Starting with \code{sigma}, this parameter for the k-th iteration is \code{sigma *f ^(-k)}}

\item{oneway}{logical: only displace towards the target without taking into
account the displacement from the target.}

\item{lm1}{A k x 3 matrix containing landmarks corrresponding to mesh1 for
initial rotation of mesh1 onto mesh2.}

\item{lm2}{A k x 3 matrix containing landmarks corrresponding to mesh2 for
initial rotation of mesh1 onto mesh2.}

\item{rigid}{named list. Passing parameters to \code{\link{icp}}, for rigid registration. If landmarks are provided and only those should count, set rigid$iterations=0.}

\item{similarity}{named list. Passing parameters to \code{\link{icp}}, for similarity registration (rigid +scaling). If landmarks are provided and only those should count, set similarity$iterations=0 (and rigid=NULL).}

\item{affine}{named list. Passing parameters to \code{\link{icp}}, for affine registration. If landmarks are provided and only those should count, set similarity$iterations=0 (with rigid=NULL and similarity=NULL)}

\item{nh}{Integer: neighbourhood (number vertices) for controlling
displacement smoothing, default is 150/mesh resolution.}

\item{toldist}{Integer: Exclude everything from the whole procedure with a
greater distance from initial point than toldist. 0 disables this feature.}

\item{pro}{which projection method to use: "m"= \code{\link{closemeshKD}}
from Morpho; "v"= \code{\link{vcgClost}} from package Rvcg}

\item{k0}{Integer: argument passed to closemeshKD (will be argument "k" in
\code{\link{closemeshKD}} .}

\item{prometh}{argument passed to closemeshKD.  Integer: 0 or 1. If
prometh=0, take closest point for displacement. If prometh=1, do not just
take the closest point, but for two absolut distances which are the same,
take the point which is orthogonal to the closest face see Moshfeghi 1994).}

\item{angtol}{numeric: If the angle between hit points' normals and the
starting points' normals exceeds this threshold the displacement vector will
be discarded.}

\item{border}{Logical: if TRUE, displacement vectors hitting mesh borders
are discarded.}

\item{horiz.disp}{numeric: If the angle between hit points' normals
(independent of its orientation) and the distance vector between hit point
and starting points exceeds this threshold, the displacement vector will be
discarded. Reduces distortion especially at mesh borders.}

\item{AmbergK}{a single integer or an integer vector vector containing the \code{k0}-value (normal slackness) for each iteration for a smooth Deformation using \code{\link{AmbergDeformSpam}}.}

\item{AmbergLambda}{as single numeric value or a numeric vector containing the \code{lambda}-value for each iteration for a smooth Deformation using \code{\link{AmbergDeformSpam}}.}

\item{tol}{convergence threshold: if RMSE between iterations is below tol, the function stops.}

\item{useConstrained}{logical: if TRUE and Bayes and landmarks are defined, the landmarks are not only used to get a suitable reference but the model will also be constrained by the landmarks to subsequently restrict the shape variability. If FALSE, the full model is used.}

\item{angclost}{if TRUE, the closest k faces will be evaluated and the closest with the appropriate normal angle will be selected.}

\item{noinc}{after each iteration the RMSE between target and moving image is calculated and if this value increases compared to a previous value, the matching stops. Can be useful when matching a statistical model to a partial shape.}

\item{silent}{logical suppress messages}

\item{visualize}{logical: if TRUE the matching process is visualized}

\item{folder}{character: if specified, each a screenshot of each deformation step will be saved as a png file in this folder.}

\item{col1}{color of fix mesh (if visualize = TRUE)}

\item{col2}{color of moving mesh (if visualize = TRUE)}

\item{bbox}{a 8 x 3 matrix with each row containing the corner of a bounding box generated with the function \code{\link{getMeshBox}}, or complying with the specification of \code{corners} in \code{\link{makeBox}}. Everything outside this box will be ignored.}

\item{\dots}{Further arguments passed to \code{nn2}.}
}
\value{
If a patch is specified:
 \item{mesh}{matched mesh}
 \item{patch}{displaced patch as specified in input.}
else a mesh of class "mesh3d" is returned.

\description{
Map a reference mesh onto a target surface using displacement fields.

\details{
This function implements the mesh matching method suggested by Moshfeghi et
al. and Bryan et al.. Additional mechanisms for controlling and restricting
the displacement smoothing are implemented

\examples{
require(Morpho)
data(nose)##load data
##warp a mesh onto another landmark configuration:
warpnose.long <- warp.mesh(shortnose.mesh,shortnose.lm,longnose.lm)
### result won't be too good as the surfaces do stronly differ.
## we start with an affine transformation initiated by landmarks
affine <- list(iterations=200,subsample=100,rhotol=pi/2,uprange=0.9)
 match <- gaussMatch(shortnose.mesh,warpnose.long,lm1=shortnose.lm,lm2=longnose.lm,gamma=4,iterations=10,smooth=1,smoothtype="h",smoothit=10,nh=50,angtol=pi/2,affine=affine,sigma=100)
